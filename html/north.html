            <h2>Copacabana Beach, Brazil</h2>
            <img src="/assets/images/image 7.jpg" alt="Copacabana Beach">
            <p>A lively beach known for its vibrant atmosphere and beautiful scenery.
                Copacabana, sector of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, occupying a narrow strip of land between the
                mountains and the sea. It is famous for its magnificent 2 1/2-mile (4-km) curved beach. Skyscraper
                hotels, apartment houses, caf√©s, nightclubs, restaurants, theaters, and bars line the waterfront.
                Copacabana is almost a self-contained city; its traffic congestion has been progressively eased by the
                construction of tunnels and a subway system to connect it with other parts of Rio de Janeiro as well as
                by a major landfill project that reconstructed the beach beyond a substantially widened Avenida
                Atlantica.
